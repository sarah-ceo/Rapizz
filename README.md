# Rapizz
This is a school project: a template app for a fictional pizza shop (Rapizz) that relies on a MySQL database.

More details about the project can be found in [this file](Rapport.pdf) (in French) and a video demonstration can be found [here](Rapizz.mp4). 

This project was made with Pierre PERRIER-RIDET (pierre.perrierridet@gmail.com).
